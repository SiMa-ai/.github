## Overview

At **SiMa.ai**, we are pioneering the next wave of **Physical AI** – seamlessly combining **computer vision, multimodal language understanding, and edge performance** to bring AI out of the cloud and into the real world.  

Our GitHub organization hosts open-source and collaborative projects that demonstrate the power of our **Machine Learning SoC (MLSoC™)** and ecosystem. From **Vision AI pipelines** to **multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** and **custom Yocto Linux builds**, SiMa’s repositories showcase how AI can be deployed at scale with **low power, high performance, and developer-first usability**.


## What You’ll Find Here

- **Demos & Examples**: End-to-end applications and pipelines that illustrate the art of the possible.  
- **Tools**: Utilities, and documentation for rapid AI development and deployment.  
- **System-Level Projects**:  
  - Build your own **custom Yocto Linux image** tailored for SiMa hardware platforms.  
  - Board bring-up resources, kernel drivers, and low-level system enablement.  
  - Recipes, layers, and integration examples for MLSoC.
